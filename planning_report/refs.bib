    abstract = {Synchronization of neural oscillations is thought to facilitate communication in the brain. Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) can result in synaptic reorganization of the motor circuit, leading to altered neuronal dynamics and impaired neural communication. Treatments for PD aim to restore network function via pharmacological means such as dopamine replacement, or by suppressing pathological oscillations with deep brain stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that brain stimulation can operate beyond a simple “reversible lesion” effect to augment network communication. Specifically, we examined the modulation of beta band (14–30 Hz) activity, a known biomarker of motor deficits and potential control signal for stimulation in Parkinson’s. To do this we setup a neural mass model of population activity within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) circuit with parameters that were constrained to yield spectral features comparable to those in experimental Parkinsonism. We modulated the connectivity of two major pathways known to be disrupted in PD and constructed statistical summaries of the spectra and functional connectivity of the resulting spontaneous activity. These were then used to assess the network-wide outcomes of closed-loop stimulation delivered to motor cortex and phase locked to subthalamic beta activity. Our results demonstrate that the spatial pattern of beta synchrony is dependent upon the strength of inputs to the STN. Precisely timed stimulation has the capacity to recover network states, with stimulation phase inducing activity with distinct spectral and spatial properties. These results provide a theoretical basis for the design of the next-generation brain stimulators that aim to restore neural communication in disease.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effect of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is key to elucidating how neural networks change over long timescales and to design interventions aimed at modulating such networks in neurological disorders. However, progress is restricted by the significant computational cost associated with simulating neural network models with STDP and by the lack of low-dimensional description that could provide analytical insights. Phase-difference-dependent plasticity (PDDP) rules approximate STDP in phase oscillator networks, which prescribe synaptic changes based on phase differences of neuron pairs rather than differences in spike timing. Here we construct mean-field approximations for phase oscillator networks with STDP to describe part of the phase space for this very high-dimensional system. We first show that single-harmonic PDDP rules can approximate a simple form of symmetric STDP, while multiharmonic rules are required to accurately approximate causal STDP. We then derive exact expressions for the evolution of the average PDDP coupling weight in terms of network synchrony. For adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators that form clusters, we formulate a family of low-dimensional descriptions based on the mean-field dynamics of each cluster and average coupling weights between and within clusters. Finally, we show that such a two-cluster mean-field model can be fitted to synthetic data to provide a low-dimensional approximation of a full adaptive network with symmetric STDP. Our framework represents a step toward a low-dimensional description of adaptive networks with STDP, and could for example inform the development of new therapies aimed at maximizing the long-lasting effects of brain stimulation.}
